# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

# General
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

# Data structures

# Tasks

## 0. New node
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t `*binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where `parent` is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
* And `value` is the value to put in the new node
* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure

## 1. Insert left
function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
* Where `parent` is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
* And `value` is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure or if `parent` is `NULL`
* If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the     new node.

## 2. Insert right
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t `*binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where `parent` is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
* And `value` is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure or if `parent` is `NULL`
* If `parent` already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.
